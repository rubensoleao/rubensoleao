###  🐧🐧🐧 Hi there 👋 🐍🐍🐍

Currently working in Quebec, Canada. Born in Brazil but lived in the U.S. for over 6 years.

I am a backend-focused full-stack developer. I’ve been programming sice I was 13 and for for the past 5 years I mostly
worked with Python, TypeScript, React.JS and VueJS. But I enjoy exploring new languages, technologies, and
methodologies.

My enthusiasm for contributing extends beyond programming, encompassing collaboration with product design,
stakeholders, frontend and backend development teams, always fostering effective teamwork
