###  🐧🐧🐧 Hi there 👋 🐍🐍🐍

I'm a Python developer who likes refactoring and writing code using good design principles and TDD. I've programmed in python for over 5 years for research and for fun. And have been programming professionally for about 2 years using multiple technologies including VueJS, ReactJS and Elixir with a specialization in Python backend development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **VueJS** and **FastAPI**.
